# SiameseChemNet
This rep provides a general interface for training and evaluating a siamese network implemented in pytorch.
The repo contains the following:
1) A custom relabeler to generate a dataset with pairs of triples
2) A dataloader to save and load the dataset to excel
3) A logger class providing an easy interface to log to tensorboard
4) Extended interface for networks in pytorch for easy training and validation
